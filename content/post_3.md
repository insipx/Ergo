#### On August 13, I was shocked by the news of the massive layoffs at the Mozilla.
---
The first information I got from Twitter about lays off one person from Mozilla's Rust team:

## The next swallow
---
The next swallow was the news from Hacker News about abbreviations in the [Servo]( https://servo.org/) team, which I
consider one of the fundamental projects of the Rust language.

## How money changes principles

[Mitchell Baker: Changing World, Changing Mozilla.](https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2020/08/11/changing-world-changing-mozilla)

This blog announcement was released before layoffs and freezing projects as Servo in the Mozilla. The announcement based
on the 5 point. And if you read between the lines, then the main message is indicated in the last paragraph: focus on
the economy:
{% quote(author="Mitchell Baker") %} Building a better internet by creating new kinds of value in Firefox; investing in innovation and creating
new products; and adjusting our finances to ensure stability over the long term.
%}

An old adage immediately comes to mind: if you don't see an obvious reason for an act, then most likely it's money. You can remember about The Mozilla
Manifesto with the pledge for a Healthy Internet and Mozilla Foundation that non-profit organization. And as a
counterbalance to this the Mozilla Corporation with its own `economics goals`.

## Laying the foundation for Rust's future

seems Rust teams was to be shocked but not destroyed and in a blog post the Rust Core team reported:
{% quote(author="The Rust Core Team") %}
There’s no denying the impact these layoffs have had on all members of the Rust community, particularly the folks who
have lost their jobs in the middle of a global pandemic. Notwithstanding the deep personal impact, the Rust project as
a whole is very resilient to such events. We have leaders and contributors from a diverse set of different backgrounds
and employers, and that diversity is a critical strength. Further, it is a common misconception that all of the Mozilla
employees who participated in Rust leadership did so as a part of their employment. In fact, many Mozilla employees in
Rust leadership contributed to Rust in their personal time, not as a part of their job. Finally, we would like to
emphasize that membership in Rust teams is given to individuals and is not connected to one’s employer. Mozilla employees
who are also members of the Rust teams continue to be members today, even if they were affected by the layoffs. Of
course, some may choose to scale back their involvement.

Later they make an announcement about creation of Rust foundation:
