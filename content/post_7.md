Reading articles starting to be part of the engineer job. Reading articles could be even effective
as well as reading focused books ether courses. I especially like series of article around one
topic, usually they have written by professionals and described quite deeply to reveal the topic.
Let's go through my top list for over the past year.

## Patterns of Distributed Systems

Remarkable series in Martin Fowler blog - [Patterns of Distributed Systems](https://martinfowler.com/articles/patterns-of-distributed-systems/). Series was written by Unmesh Joshi and pretty well cover world of distributed system with their challenges and patterns.  

## Memory management in modern programming languages
Fab series with awesome visualising of different [memory management models in modern languages](https://deepu.tech/memory-management-in-programming/).

## JVM Anatomy Quarks

[JVM Anatomy Quarks](https://shipilev.net/jvm/anatomy-quarks/) is the on-going mini-post series,
where every post is describing some elementary piece of knowledge about JVM. The unimaginable work
of [Aleksey ShipilÃ«v](https://twitter.com/shipilev), I believe sooner or later a book will be
published on the basis of this.

## Distributed Systems Lecture Series
Awesome [lecture series on distributed systems](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB) given as part of the undergraduate computer science course at the University of Cambridge. An author is a notorious man in the "distributed" world - Martin Kleppmann, who also gave us a remarkable book - [Design Data Intensive Applications](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/). I strongly recommend both mentioned creations of this author.
