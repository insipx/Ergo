With the coming  of the new era of cloud native services, the size of image dockers for applications that included
JDK caused a slight puzzlement. The huge JDK in our Docker containers is just the tip of the problem (which can be
solved by the jigsaw project though). The real problem is what made Java so successful - its virtual machine, which we
also have to run in containers (Mostly HotSpot VM).

## Go language as an irritant
The emergence of a new language with new advantages exposed already known problems. The emergence of a new language with
 new advantages exposed to already known problems. Really small microservices with fast startup written on the Go
 language made a real competition to microservices written on Java.

 ## GraalVM -> new stage of java infrastructure evolution
 Oracle Corporation has bet on a new virtual machine GraalVM. Its idea lies in 2 key features: a polyglot virtual
 machine not only for JVM languages and cloud native java images.
