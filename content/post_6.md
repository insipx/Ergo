## The state of the Rust in Belarus

Rust 1.0 was announced in 2015 and aroused interest among developers. First mention Rust community
in Belarus dated March 9, 2016
at [Facebook group: Rust.by](https://web.facebook.com/groups/1673382339595171) . Pretty promising,
right?

## Maturity with a maturity of the language

So starting in 2016 the community was developed up to 40 people. Belarus Rust user group was lead
by [ Avatar Konstantin Stepanov](https://github.com/kstep). Rust meetups was supported
by [Netcracker Technology](https://companies.dev.by/netcracker).

Unfortunately starting in 2019 there was a community decline (Mostly related to the inactivity of
Konstantin).

## My contribution

My interest in Rust woke up in 2019. Inspired by ideas and benefits of language I'm starting to
explore it by writing some code (even playing with CodeSignal algorithms implemented on Rust).

Later I had a chance to chat with local
blogger [ItBeard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeObZv89Stb2xLtjLJ0De3Q) who focused on
interviewing persons from It (focused on different languages and directions). I'm kindly chasing him
to build a video about Rust and even have a chance to recommend taking an interview on
Konstantine[Enjoy Everything about Rust!](https://youtu.be/AdhFDgE1J1E).

## Rust BY

And finally, I decide to continue to develop our Belarus Rust community and start the Telegram channel
of [Belarus Rust community](https://t.me/rustlang_by_chat). Join our community and grow with us!
