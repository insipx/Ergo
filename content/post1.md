# That's one small step for mankind, one giant leap for one man.
Here we go, i finally decide to start my own tech blog. I already made some commitments as Java Innovation Head in Godel
to share some ideas within a company and decide that it would be be useful to share thoughts within other ppl as well.

As far as I try to consider myself an Rust enthusiast i chose Zola as static site generator.
