## That's one small step for mankind, one giant leap for one man.
Here we go, i finally decide to start my own tech blog. I already made some commitments as Java Innovation Head in Godel
to share some ideas within a company and decide that it would be useful to share thoughts within other ppl as well.

As far as I try to consider myself an Rust enthusiast i chose Zola as static site generator. Sure you could say:
Hey what's about common Hugo written on Go or Jekyll actively supported by Github Pages written on Ruby?. And i could
answer your question by reference to official github page of Zola that include comparative table:
[Zola github](https://github.com/getzola/zola).

As theme i chose [Ergo](https://github.com/insipx/Ergo) and little bit customize it. Moreover I found proper Gitlab
Action to adopt build Zola from repo and Deploy to Github page from separate gh-phages branch. You able to figure our
all modification and configurations on my github repo with this site template:
[blog github](https://github.com/nolik/blog).

If you have any question about either about Zola or about any tech stuff AMA.
