Huh, what's the crazy year! War that change our lives. Also, I had some old dream to move away from mouse.
Starting from tiling window DE adoption I used i3/sway I really impressed with power of tiling and shortcuts
(btw I use arch). So what if I will go further? I decide that will be nice to move out from mouse using at all.


## Vim motions

Probably the simplest way to move out from mouse its use Vim and Vim motions for navigation. Firstly I'm sure exploring
vim navigations with Vim. Even if at the start I used the vim more like text editor. I've explored vim shortcuts in the 
different ways. Starting from simple articles like [Moving fast with the core vim motions](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/boost-your-coding-fu-with-vscode-and-vim/moving-blazingly-fast-with-the-core-vim-motions/) and [Vim motions cheatsheet](https://www.barbarianmeetscoding.com/boost-your-coding-fu-with-vscode-and-vim/cheatsheet). Straggling at the beginning but with a time 
it's really improve navigation time. 


## Best Vim learning channel

Just following the Rust content I surprisingly figured out awesome channel with content about programming languages but
as well with a bunch of Vim learning videos [moving fast with the core vim motions](https://www.youtube.com/@theprimeagen).
strongly recommend The Primeagen channel and especially [vim as your editor playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6ar2rmb5te&list=plm323lc7isw_wuxqmkx_xxntjc_hjbq7r) for learning vim.


## Not ready for NeoVim as the main IDE

And yah NeoVim configuration and plugins it's another challenge that you may face. Different LSP for different languages,
a bunch of plugins (such as Telescope for navigation) to make your hardcore life a little easies. And it's really take a time.
Just following the Rust content I surprisingly figured out that there is vim like editor named [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/).
The main feature of which is pre-configuration(that includes LSP/navigation/etc.) and good multiline editing support
(despite that it's blazing fast coz written on Rust lol). But yah, even with this simplification of Helix I'm not ready to
move out of Intellij IDEA. Not yet... 
And this lead me to try [IdeaVim plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/164-ideavim) that brings vim features into
Idea. And would recommend to check [Sebastian Daschner blog](https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/my-favorite-ideavim-features)
series about how to use IdeaVim and even provide some config samples. IdeaVim have pretty a lot of issues with shortcuts
conflicts with Idea shortcuts, but I still find IdeaVim option like a compromise between powerful IDE and vim features 
at the same time. Who knows probably later I will find a straight to fully move into neoVim.


## What to do with Browsers navigation?

If you decide to move out from mouse probably the most confusing part will be - how to interact with web in Browsers.
In my case I'm using Firefox Developer Edition, and it's having some default key bindings to scroll and change the tabs, but
it's far away for regular using without mouse. And I'm open for themselves one more usefully Firefox plugin - 
[Vimium-FF](https://addons.mozilla.org/ru/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/). It's follow vim motions shortcuts idea and try to handle
all navigation parts with it. Yah at the start it's pretty confusing, but later you will be ready to surf websites and 
even complete navigation with opening all links with special shortcuts. And still - there is no any way to fully escape 
from the mouse, you should be ready that a lot of sites use some Native maps/ Frames that doesn't provide you ability to
use navigation/link-opening without a mouse.


## To be continued

It's just start of my journey to use more keyboard/vim motions and reduce using of mouse, but let's see how it goes.
