## The Real Aim of Benchmarks
Comparison benchmarks in IT industry it's not the only way to prove some metric supremacy of some tech/frameworks, but also a way to promote your technology. The last point is often interested in vendors and companies providing consulting services. By myself, from time to time I check [Web Framework Benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks) to see how freaking fast Rust frameworks like Actix in comparison to more adopted web frameworks writen on other languages.

## Kafka supremacy

## The ~Empire~ Pulsar Strikes Back

## Why you should be sceptical about Benchmarks
1. Methodology - each benchmarker use own metodology that often doesn't represent all side of compared technologies that put technologies into uncompetitive environment.
2. Expertiese in wishful technology and incompitence in other - as a result we able to see benchmarks where compared competetive technology could be not correctly settuped/configured.
3. Wishful thinking of authours - results of benchmarks could be interpritied wrongly with desire put one technology into better position to other.
